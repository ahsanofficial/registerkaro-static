        "question": "Why to Change Auditor in every 5 years?",
        "answer": "Initial audits have a greater rate of failure compared to audits conducted in later years. This signifies that every five years, auditors will conduct additional audits that are inaccurate. New auditors will need time to adjust during their first year, which could result in a less effective audit."
