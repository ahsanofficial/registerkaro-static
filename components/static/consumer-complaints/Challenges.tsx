          <p><strong>Tedious Process</strong>The process for Consumer Complaint redressal is a multi dimensional process which demands heavy input when it comes to filing documents, evidence, and keeping a track of the follow up. These multidimensional prospects make the entire process tedious.</p>
          <p><strong>Complex filing</strong>Being a multidimensional process, there are a number of documents that are required to be filed at different stages of the process such as application, response to the application, etc.</p>
          <p><strong>Rigorous Follow-up</strong>The other important step in the consumer complaint process is the rigorous follow up to be taken care of at every stage. This creates a challenge in the process while proceeding ahead with the complaint at the consumer forum</p>
