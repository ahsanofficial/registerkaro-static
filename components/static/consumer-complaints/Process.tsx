Consumers are granted a number of legal rights and safeguards under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. This Act allows a customer to file a formal Consumer complaint and bring a business or service provider to court. This particular concern is referred to as an online consumer complaint. A Consumer complaint is usually filed if the company disregards a court order to fix the issue. When filing a Consumer complaint, all required details and supporting documentation must be sent in. India’s consumer courts provide customers with timely legal advice and rulings.</p>
