      <p className='main-para mb-2'> The voluntary winding up of a company is the second way to achieve closure.

      <p className='main-para mb-2'>The main objective of the wind-up is to make a profit from the company, which has neither a promising future nor a remaining mission. The court does not require this kind of winding up or liquidation. It is only authorized by the company’s board of directors and shareholders, even under unfavorable market conditions where stakeholders believe the business is having difficulties as a result. They can then enact a resolution to dissolve the business.</p>
