        <p><strong>Note: </strong>Registering a Public Limited Company typically takes several weeks to a few months, depending on the country and the complexity of the company's structure. Public Limited Company registration involves creating a legal entity that offers shares to the public for purchase and trading on a stock exchange. This process includes meeting requirements such as minimum share capital and appointing directors.</p>
