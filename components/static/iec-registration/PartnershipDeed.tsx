In all such instances, the Traderâ€™s PAN shall be constructed as a new IEC Code for the purpose of Import & Export. IEC does not need to be taken in case the products exported/imported are for purpose purposes and are not used for any commercial purpose. Import or export is done by the Departments of Indian Government & Ministries and Notified Charitable Institutions to need not require getting IEC.</p>
