          <p><strong>1. </strong> Transfer pricing is complicated by the various factors that must be taken into account, including the functions carried out, risks taken, and assets used by each entity participating in the intra-group transaction. Analyzing similar transactions and economic conditions is necessary to establish a suitable transfer price that aligns with the arm's length principle. Valuation and allocation become challenging in dealing with intangible assets like intellectual property, leading to increased complexity.</p>
          <p><strong>2. </strong> The comparable uncontrolled price method is a key approach in transfer pricing, involving the identification of similar transactions between parties with no relationship. Nonetheless, locating genuinely similar transactions may prove challenging, particularly for one-of-a-kind or specific items, services, or intangibles. Limited data availability and reliability can create uncertainties in establishing arm's length prices for comparable.</p>
          <p><strong>3. </strong> Interpretation of transfer pricing regulations and guidelines may vary, causing disagreements between multinational enterprises (MNEs) and tax authorities. In some areas without clear instructions, different methods and conflicts may arise. Disputes can occur regarding the choice of transfer pricing techniques, comparables, or the level of documentation needed. Dealing with these disagreements can take up a lot of time and resources, and they have the potential to create tension between taxpayers and tax authorities.</p>
          <p><strong>4. </strong> Different nations have varying transfer pricing regulations, leading to a complicated network of rules and documentation needs. It is crucial to have consistent transfer pricing rules across different locations to lessen compliance challenges and ensure uniformity. BEPS defines the tax planning methods employed by multinational enterprises to transfer earnings from countries with high tax rates to countries with lower tax rates. This can be done by implementing aggressive transfer pricing techniques, like overpaying royalties or management fees to connected entities in jurisdictions with lower taxes. BEPS creates difficulties for tax authorities in implementing transfer pricing regulations and collecting the correct amount of tax income.</p>
          <p><strong>5. </strong> Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) encounter difficulties in adhering to various transfer pricing regulations across different jurisdictions where they operate. Every jurisdiction could have distinct guidelines for transfer pricing, document requirements, and interpretations of the arm's length principle. This might result in discrepancies in handling intercompany transactions and raise compliance responsibilities for multinational enterprises. </p>
          <p><strong>6. </strong> Sufficient documentation on transfer pricing is essential to show adherence with transfer pricing regulations. Yet, creating thorough and up-to-date documentation that satisfies the regulations of different tax jurisdictions can be overwhelming. The documentation must contain thorough analysis, financial data, economic research, and other relevant information, which demands substantial resources and expertise.</p>
