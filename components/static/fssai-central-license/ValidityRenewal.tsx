        <div className='flex-7 pt-5'>
        <p><strong>1: Validity Duration:</strong>The Central FSSAI license offers a flexible validity ranging from 1 to 5 years. The associated cost increases in alignment with the chosen validity period.</p>
        <p><strong>2 Renewal Process:</strong>For seamless continuity, the FSSAI Central License must be renewed before the expiration date, ideally within 30 days. Failure to renew within this timeframe may result in penalties.</p>

        <li>PAN Card</li>
