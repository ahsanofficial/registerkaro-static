                <p>A pitch deck is a short presentation that provides potential investors or clients with a summary of your business plan, products, services, and growth progress. As an entrepreneur, you are likely aware that your company or concept requires funding. Frequently, this funding will be sourced externally, meaning individuals who are not friends or family members provide it. This implies that you must convey your concepts to potential investors in a manner that sparks their interest in funding your business.</p>
