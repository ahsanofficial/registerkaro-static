                <p className='text-justify'>In the banking world, there's been a lot of talk about Payment Banks lately. They're seen as the next big thing, especially for the government's goal of including more people in the financial system. These banks work like regular banks, except they don't give out loans or credit cards. Payment Banks make banking easier by offering various services through safe digital platforms. This special kind of Bank was introduced by RBI, back in 2013. They're almost similar to other banks and perform functions as defined by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 from sections 5(b) and 6(1)(a) to (o). The idea behind Payment Banks is to make payment services more accessible, especially to citizens with lower incomes and small businesses. The RBI hopes these banks will bring financial services to remote areas where they're needed most. These banks are all about making banking simpler and reaching more people, wherever they are. For eg: Bharti Airtelâ€™s Airtel Payments Bank (first payment bank of India), India Post Payments Bank, Fino Payments Bank, Jio Payments Bank etc.</p>
