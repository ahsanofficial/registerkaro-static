                <p className='text-justify'>In India, the concept of Limited Liability Partnership was introduced in 2008 by the LLP Act, 2008. In India, LLP has become the most preferred form of business among entrepreneurs. Registering an LLP in India has both the limited liability features of a Private Company and the flexibility of a Partnership Firm. No partner is answerable on account of unauthorized or illegal actions of other partners, thus individual partners are protected from joint liability created by another partner’s wrongdoing. LLP is generally preferred by professionals, Micro & Small businesses that are family owned or closely held. In 2022, the MCA (Ministry of Corporate Affairs) introduced LLP (Second Amendment) Rules, 2022 and it has made the procedure of LLP Registration even easier & transparent as now all the LLP Forms will be digital-based forms. Also, with the LLP (Second Amendment) Rules, 2022, Limited Liability Partnerships shall be allotted their TAN & PAN along with the Certificate of Incorporation itself.</p>
