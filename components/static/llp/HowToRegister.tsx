But before applying for the name reservation, it is necessary to use the free name search facility on MCA Portal. The system will provide the list of closely resembling names of existing companies/LLPs based on the search criteria. This will definitely help you choose names not identical to already registered names. The Registrar will approve the proposed name only if the name is not undesirable in the Central Government’s opinion & doesn’t resemble any existing Partnership Firm or an LLP or a body corporate or a Trademark.</p>
