                <p className='text-justify'>A legal challenge made against a trademarkâ€™s registration by a third party is known as trademark opposition. Through this procedure, third parties can object to the registration of a new trademark application that they feel may violate their rights to an existing brand or confuse customers by being confusingly similar to an already-registered trademark. The Trademark opposition is filed within four months from the date of advertisement of the re-advertisement of the trademark in the Indian Trademark Journal by filing a form TM-O along with the prescribed fee.</p>
