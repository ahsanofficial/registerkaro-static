            <strong>1. Migration to GST: </strong>Any person who was registered
            under any of the previous indirect tax laws had to migrate
            mandatorily to the GST. Such migrated taxpayers, who are not making
            any inter-state supplies, can request for cancellation. However the
            request can only be made after passing of one year from the date of
            registration.

            closing, amalgamation and disposing off of business, cancellation
            can be requested by the taxpayer himself. However in cases of
            transfer of business the transferee shall be a registered person.

            appropriate GST officer can also initiate cancellation process on

                <p><strong>c. </strong>Issuing invoices without the delivery of goods or services.</p>
                <p><strong>d. </strong>Taxpayer didnâ€™t file GSTR-1 due to non-filing of GSTR-3B for more than 2 regular months or one quarter for those who opted for QRMP scheme.</p>
                <p><strong>e. </strong>Usage of ITC from electronic credit ledger to discharge liability which is greater than 99 percent of the total tax liability by specified taxpayers.</p>
            </div>
