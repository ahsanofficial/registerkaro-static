            <p><strong>2. </strong>The initial step in conducting an online search is to conduct a keyword search on Trademarks/brands that you think might be identical to yours;</p>
            <p><strong>3. </strong>If the name entered doesnâ€™t match anything within your given search parameters, move on to;</p>
            <p><strong>4. </strong>To determine if the name is on file with the Trademark Registry, check the Trademark Registry or conduct an IP India Public Search;</p>

            <p><strong>6. </strong>If someone else has filed for protection of their brand name against the use of yours, this will be noted in each database record & generally includes links to their respective application.</p>
