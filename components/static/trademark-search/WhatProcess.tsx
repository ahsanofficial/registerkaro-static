            <p><strong>1. </strong>Searching for a Trademark Online if you are looking for details for an existing Trademark, conducting an online search is by far your best option;</p>
            <p><strong>2. </strong>The initial step in conducting an online search is to conduct a keyword search on Trademarks/brands that you think might be identical to yours;</p>
            <p><strong>3. </strong>If the name entered doesnâ€™t match anything within your given search parameters, move on to;</p>
            <p><strong>4. </strong>To determine if the name is on file with the Trademark Registry, check the Trademark Registry or conduct an IP {cityName} Public Search;</p>
            <p><strong>5. </strong>Sometimes these databases will provide some insight into whether or not another company has filed for safeguarding their brand name against your use as well;</p>
            <p><strong>6. </strong>If someone else has filed for protection of their brand name against the use of yours, this will be noted in each database record & generally includes links to their respective application.</p>
