           <p><strong>1 : </strong>Select the organizational structure for your company. It may be a corporation, partnership, or sole proprietorship.</p>
           <p><strong>2 : </strong>Select a name for your company. The name must be original and not previously registered to a Canadian company. To make sure your name isn't already taken, check the databases for company registries and Canadian corporate names. Additionally, look through your province's business directory; a company name registered in one province does not entitle it to use that name on a federal level.</p>
           <p><strong>3 : </strong>Obtain a business registration from your government.</p>
           <p><strong>4 : </strong>Determine which licenses and permits you might need.</p>
           <p><strong>5 : </strong>Bank account for business opening as your business registration documents will be requested to be viewed by the banks.</p>
           <p><strong>6 : </strong>Plan your tax payment [A CRA liaison officer can provide free tax assistance to small business owners].</p>
