        EPFO establishes the processes for withdrawals from the PF after
        Resignation. As per the Rules, employees who have been unemployed for 2
        months or more are allowed to withdraw the complete balance in their
        Provident Fund Account. This shows that a person who resigns from their
        job may withdraw the complete balance in their account 2 months after
        their last day of employment.

        Before an employee can take the entire amount from the Provident Fund
        (PF) account, a number of limits & requirements must be satisfied. The
        employee must have worked for the present company or organisation for a
        minimum of 5 years, which is one of the vital conditions. If the
        employee hasnâ€™t yet worked for 5 years, they are only permitted to
        withdraw the money they deposited to the Provident Fund account,
        interest-free.
