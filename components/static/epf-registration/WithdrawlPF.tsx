            EPFO establishes the processes for withdrawals from the PF after
            Resignation. As per the Rules, employees who have been unemployed
            for 2 months or more are allowed to withdraw the complete balance in
            their Provident Fund Account. This shows that a person who resigns
            from their job may withdraw the complete balance in their account 2
            months after their last day of employment.
          </p>
          <p >
            Before an employee can take the entire amount from the Provident
            Fund (PF) account, a number of limits & requirements must be
            satisfied. The employee must have worked for the present company or
            organisation for a minimum of 5 years, which is one of the vital
            conditions. If the employee hasnâ€™t yet worked for 5 years, they are
            only permitted to withdraw the money they deposited to the Provident
            Fund account, interest-free.
