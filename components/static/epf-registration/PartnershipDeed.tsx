        Before paying the salaries of employees, the employer must deduct the
        contribution of the employee. The EPFO will thereafter receive both the
        employer share & employee half within 15 days of the end of each month.
        The EPF Registration is unique in terms of returns from a debt
        instrument. A sovereign guarantees the currency & the interest is
        tax-free. The PF has exempt status since contributions are
        tax-deductible from income. Debt securities with such large yields &
        solid safety & reliability are uncommon. Hence, to reduce the temptation
        to withdraw money, itâ€™s good to relocate the PF account while switching
        jobs.
