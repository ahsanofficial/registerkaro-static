            Before paying the salaries of employees, the employer must deduct
            the contribution of the employee. The EPFO will thereafter receive
            both the employer share & employee half within 15 days of the end of
            each month. The EPF Registration is unique in terms of returns from
            a debt instrument. A sovereign guarantees the currency & the
            interest is tax-free. The PF has exempt status since contributions
            are tax-deductible from income. Debt securities with such large
            yields & solid safety & reliability are uncommon. Hence, to reduce
            the temptation to withdraw money, itâ€™s good to relocate the PF
            account while switching jobs.
