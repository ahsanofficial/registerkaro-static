        In India, the employer must obtain the EPF Registration within 1 month
        of attaining the strength, failing which penalties will be applicable. A
        registered establishment continues to be under the Act even if the
        employee strength falls below the required minimum. The Central
        Government of India may apply the provisions to any establishment
        employing less than 20 employees after giving not less than 2 monthsâ€™
        notice for mandatory registration. Where the employer & the most of
        employees have agreed that the provisions of this act should be made
        applicable to the establishment, they may themselves apply to the
        Central PF Commissioner.

        The Commissioner may apply the provisions of the Act to that
