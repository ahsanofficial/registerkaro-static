            E-Waste is one of the worldâ€™s fastest growing trash streams. India
            currently produces nearly 50 million tonnes of it per year, and the
            number is going to rise as electronic garbage, refers to obsolete,
            unwanted, or defective electrical and electronic equipment. That
            includes everything from smart phones to refrigerators that have
            reached the end of their useful lives.
