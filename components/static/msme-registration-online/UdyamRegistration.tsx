       The Union MSME Ministry established Udyam in 2020 as an online system for registering micro, small, and medium businesses. A free Udyam registration for their business can be obtained through a fully digital and paperless process based on self-declaration. Udyam registration is required to benefit from the Ministry of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprisesâ€™ schemes or programs such as the Credit Guarantee Scheme, public procurement policy, an advantage in government tenders, and protection against late payments, among others.
