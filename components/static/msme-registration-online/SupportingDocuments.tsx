        The Udyam Registration process boasts no MSME registration fees and
        eliminates the need for document proofs. The Udyam Registration Portal
        seamlessly retrieves PAN and GST-linked details from Government
        databases, thanks to its integration with the Income Tax and GSTIN
        systems. Notably, GST registration is optional for enterprises not
        requiring it; however, those mandated to obtain GST registration under
        the GST law must input their GSTIN for MSME or Udyam Registration.
