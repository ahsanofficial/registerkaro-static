                <p>Tax withheld by the payer or deductor prior to transferring funds to the payee or deductee during a transaction is known as TDS (Tax Deducted at Source). For instance, before paying you (Payee/deductee), your employer (Payer/deductor) deducts a certain amount as tax (TDS) from your income. After that, the money that was taken out is remitted on your behalf to the government. You will have your total tax liability offset by this TDS. People are, therefore, unable to avoid paying taxes because the government is aware of their income and financial activities, and the taxes they owe are recorded.</p>
