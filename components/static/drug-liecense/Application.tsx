           <p>Let's say you want to distribute pharmaceuticals or open a medical supply business and need a drug license. If so, you have to meet the educational requirements outlined in the 1940 Drugs and Cosmetic Act. A pharmacy degree is required of both competent individuals and pharmacists. The qualified individual needs to have prior drug distribution expertise. The pharmacist must maintain their registration with the Pharmacist Council at the same time. Since the Drug License Application will be submitted, they should have proof. </p>
