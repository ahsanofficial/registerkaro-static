        <p>A common choice for new businesses is a private limited company, suitable for both small and large-scale enterprises. Initial capital can originate from the owner, family, or private equity sources. As businesses grow and require additional funds for expansion, they have the option to convert into a public limited company by offering shares on the stock exchange. Furthermore, companies can raise capital by issuing debt securities like bonds and medium-term notes. This transition allows them to access public investment and diversify their financial strategies. Private Limited Company holds certain distinctive features such as:</p>
        <p><strong>1. Owner</strong></p>
        <p>Owner in a private limited Company is known as a shareholder which should be 1 minimum and can extend maximum to 200. This shareholder can either be an individual, a trust, another entity, or a company.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Limited liability</strong></p>
        <p>The private limited company is limited in its liability, defining that the shareholders are protected against the liability of the company.
