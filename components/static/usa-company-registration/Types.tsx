            <strong>S Corporations</strong>
            These are small business entities that provide pass-through taxes,
            allowing revenue and losses to be reported on shareholdersâ€™
            individual tax returns.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Corporate Entities (C-Corp)</strong>
            C-Corporations are separate legal entities with their own tax
            obligations and benefits. They have the ability to issue shares and
            have several classes of shareholders.

            <strong>Nonprofit Organizations</strong>
            Established for philanthropic, educational, religious, or social
            reasons, nonprofit organizations are eligible for specific tax
            advantages.

            <strong>Limited Liability Companies (LLCs)</strong>
            LLCs combine the flexibility of pass-through taxation with the
            limited liability protection of corporations. They are a well-liked
            option for small companies.

            <strong>Single-Person Businesses</strong>
            These are the most basic types of businesses, where one person owns
            and runs the company. They are also referred to as sole
            proprietorships. They are simple to set up, even though they offer
            no liability protection.
