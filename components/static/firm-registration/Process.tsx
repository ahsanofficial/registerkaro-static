                <p className='text-justify'>Under section 7 of the Companies Act, 2013 it is stated that for a company to have some legal existence it must be registered with the registrar of the jurisdiction in which the company is situated. There are several types in which a business may be registered- such as a firm or a company. A firm is generally considered an informal way of business, owned by the Partners of the business and is done in fields that require in-depth knowledge of a particular field or professional practices and they need to have high flexibility in business management such as chartered accountants firms, law firms and consultancy firms. Whereas, a company is a formal structure of business, which is owned by shareholders. Companies have to adhere to more legal compliances and require minimum capital to start a company as compared to a firm. Firm hence can be defined as when two individuals come together to do a business they are individually known as <strong>Partners</strong> whereas collectively they are known as <strong>Firms</strong></p>
