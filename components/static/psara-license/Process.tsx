This rapid proliferation of small businesses in the commercial realm has underscored the imperative for security and safety measures.

In India, the Private Security Agency (Regulation) Act, 2005 (PSARA) vigilantly oversees all operations and activities of these diverse private security agencies.</p>

This legislation provides the framework for establishing a legitimate private security agency in India. Furthermore, the Act governs every facet of private security agencies in the country, encompassing aspects such as registration and the recruitment of personnel for security services.</p>
