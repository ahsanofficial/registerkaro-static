In addition to having unique problems of their own, all of { cityName }â€™s states have also passed state-specific laws pertaining to stores and establishments. The local government, which is essentially the Municipal Corporation, provides registration in accordance with the rules of this state-specific statute for any kind of business to have a physical presence in { cityName }. Maharashtra is one of the states that oversees these registrations. One such registration certificate that the Bombay Shops and Establishment Act in Mumbai issues is the Gumasta license. The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai oversees the application procedure.</p>
