        <p className='main-para my-2'id='PartnershipDeed'>BIS, functioning as the National Standards Body in India, actively engages in Conformity Assessment, Standardization, and Quality Assurance across various domains, including goods, services, processes, and systems. The Indian Standards formulated by BIS serve as the foundation for Product Certification Schemes. These schemes play a crucial role in providing third-party assurance of product safety, quality, and reliability to consumers.</p>
<p className='main-para my-4'>While the BIS certification scheme is predominantly voluntary, certain products are subjected to mandatory compliance with Indian standards by the Indian Government. This compulsion is driven by considerations such as public interest, human, animal, or plant safety, environmental protection, prevention of unfair trade practices, and national security. For such products, the Indian Government mandates the usage of the Standard Mark under the Certificate of Conformity (CoC) or License issued by BIS through the issuance of Quality Control Orders (QCOs).</p>
<p className='main-para my-2'>The Central Government of India, in consultation with BIS, exercises its powers under Sections 16, 17, and 25 of the BIS Act, 2016, to publish Quality Control Orders. This regulatory measure makes it obligatory for products falling under the purview of these orders to undergo BIS Certification, thereby ensuring adherence to established standards and promoting consumer safety and satisfaction.</p>
